Title: Real-time Color Detection and Tracking System using OpenCV and Python

Description:
I recently completed an exciting project using OpenCV and Python to develop a real-time color detection and tracking system. This system allows users to select a color using a custom color picker interface and then tracks objects of that color in a live webcam feed.

Key Features:
1. **Custom Color Picker**: The system features a user-friendly interface with trackbars allowing users to select their desired color in real-time.

2. **Color Detection**: Utilizing the powerful OpenCV library, the system accurately detects objects of the selected color in the webcam feed.

3. **HSV Color Space Conversion**: The selected color is converted from the more familiar RGB color space to the HSV color space, making it easier to define color ranges and thresholds.

4. **Dynamic Thresholding**: The system dynamically adjusts the lower and upper limits of the selected color in the HSV color space, ensuring robust detection even with variations in lighting conditions.

5. **Bounding Box Visualization**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes in the webcam feed, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

6. **Real-time Operation**: The system operates in real-time, offering instantaneous feedback and seamless user interaction.

Applications:
- Industrial automation: Color-based sorting and quality control in manufacturing processes.
- Robotics: Object tracking and identification for robotic vision systems.
- Education: Interactive demonstrations for teaching image processing concepts.

This project showcases my proficiency in computer vision, image processing, and Python programming, and I'm excited to explore further applications and enhancements in this domain. If you're interested in learning more or collaborating on similar projects, feel free to reach out!
